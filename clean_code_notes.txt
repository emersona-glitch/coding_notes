Naming Things:
  Do your absolute best to not use comments, but to name functions and
  variables meaningfully.

  Variables should be named as nouns. 

  For functions, try to pick a description of the return value.

  noise words to avoid:
      The
      Info
      Data
      Variable
      Object
      Manager

  If you can't name something concisely, it may be time to refactor your Code
  so that things *can* be named simply.

  Make sure the name is pronouncable, and easily searchable

  Consistently use one word for a concept (i.e. decide between get or fetch)

Writing Functions:
  Functions should only do one thing
  That thing should be stated in its name
  This will cause the function to be short, and to utilize other, short
  functions with clear names.
