plays are dictionaries, several plays can be included in a playbook

Sections of a playbook
  
  Hosts     - The machines/locations where the play will run, aka the 'targets'
    includes:
    'Target' section:
      user: which user to log in as
      become: privilege escalation
      ansible_connection
      gather_facts: gather_facts either true or false, to gather host machine facts

  Vars      - variables that will be used in the play
    variables can be referenced using jinja scripting --
    e.g. for simply referencing a specific variable you'd use: {{ your_var }}
    
    variables can passed in from the command line using -e or --extra-vars
    e.g.
    $ ansible-playbook playbk.yaml

  Tasks     - list of tasks to be executed, also setup and teardown tasks
    includes:
      - name: human readable name of the task (also for reference)
      - module(s): modules to run as a part of the task
      - when: arguments given to signal when to run the task


  Handlers  - listed under the handlers key follow the same syntax as tasks, 
  called from the tasks section via the use of the 'notify' key in the task.
  
  Only get executed:
    when there is a change, 
    once, 
    and at the end of a text.

  
  Roles     - roles to be imported into the play (sort of like meta plays)
