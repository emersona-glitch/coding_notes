JAVASCRIPT NOTES


javascript is dynamically typed

console		=	A keyword to that allows methods of
			interraction w developers, such as printing logs


comments	=	//	single line
			/*...*/	multi line


DATA TYPES
==========

Number		=	Any number, including decimals.

String		=	Any group of characters, such as text
			preferably surrounded by single quotes '...'

Boolean		=	A true or false value
			states as _true_ or _false_ (w/o underscores)

Null		=	the absense of a value

Undefined	=	also denotes absense of a value
			this data type occurs when a variable is created
			without a value

Symbol		=	unique and used in more complex coding ;)

Objects		=	Collections of related data
			objects are the only "complex" data type,
			compare with the other six being "primitive"
			examples include the console object, math object,
			and other built in objects that allow you to perform
			more complex tasks, as well as user created functions.
==========


Operator	=	a character that performs a specific task, like
			arithmetical calculations, like  +  -  *  /  %

			these operators can be used on numbers, integers,
			and in the case of +, you can also concatenate
			strings.

arithmetic	=	built-in operators include +, - , *, /, and %
operators

properties	=	Objects (and other data types) can have properties,
			which are different types of stored information.
			properties are denoted with a their name, and
			attached to the object with a period, such as
			An example would be that every string instance has a
			property of "length," which is the number of
			characters it consists of.

methods		=	Objects (and other data types) can have methods which
			perform actions, usually on the objects. methods are
			called in the same way as properties.

variables	=	variables are containers for values.
			you can create variables that have a descriptive name
			you can store and update information in a variable
			and  you can retrieve information stored in variables

let		=	let creates (or declares) a variable giving it a name
			and (if you wish at the time) an initial value. A
			variable will have a value of undefined if it isn't
			defined when it's declared.
			variable names:
			cannot begin with a number,
			should be "camel-cased,"
			and cannot have the same names as keywords.

const		=	const behaves similarly to var or let, however when
			you declare a variable with const, it is a constant
			variable which means that you cannot update its
			value, you can only retreive it. Because of this, you
			*must* assign constant variables a value when declaring
			them.

incrementing/	=	we can increment or decrement variables by using
decrementing		++ or --
			for example: a single line of code to increment the
			variable 'a' by 1 would look like
			a++;

concatenation	=	you can concatenate strings together using the '+'
			operator. This will append strings to one another
			as is. You can also do this with variables.

Interpolation /
template	=	template literals allow you to interpolate values
literals		into strings with backticks (`) and ${...}.
			e.g. sayHi = `What's up, ${name}?`;

typeof		=	this operator can be used to figure out what data-
			type a certain variable currently is (since variables
			in javascript are dynamically typed).

comparison	=	comparison operators compare two variables or values
operators		and determine whether or not the comparison is true.
			these consist of
			<, >, <=, >=, ==, !==
			and also
			===, and !==
			which check to see if the
			values being compared are *precisely equal to one
			another (wheras == and != check to see if their
			converted values are equivalent or not, where 0, NaN
			and "" are 'falsey' and get converted to 0)
			in other words, === and !== check to see if the values
			are equivalent AND of the same type.



CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
======================

if statements	=	if statements evaluate a condition (which evaluates
			to true or false) and then proceed to execute a
			specific task. format is:
			if (condition) {
			//code to execute
			}

else statements	=	else statements are used to run a block of code when
			the initial if statement evaluates to false.
			simply

logical		=	in order to add logic to conditional evaluations,
operators		we use logical operators to evaluate the conditional
			truth of more than one statement.
			&&, ||, and !

			Logical operators can be used when defining variables
			such as:
			let defaultName = username || 'stranger';
			here, if username is undefined, defaultName will be
			defined as = 'stranger'
			also known as "short circuit evaluation.

truthy &	=	truthy values are values that are defined, not null,
falsy			exist, greater than 0 &c. where as falsy values are 0,
			undefined, empty strings, null, or not numbers.

ternary		=	the '?' operator can be used as a short hand for an
operators		if...else statement as follows:
			isTrue ? console.log('it's true') :
			console.log('it's false');
			or
			saysDunko === 'Dunko' ? console.log('it says Dunko') :
			console.log('it doesn't say Dunko');
			the semicolon separates the 2 expressions of the
			block of code. The ? mark indicates that if the
			expression is true, the first block of code will
			execute if it's false, the second will execute.

else if		=	else if statements allow your code to execute more
			than 2 possible statements. It basically works like
			a daisy chain, working from top to bottom such
			that the first condition that evaluates to true
			will execute.
			example:

			if (donkey === 1) {
			console.log('1');
			} else if (donkey === 2) {
			console.log('2');
			} else if (donkey === 3) {
			console.log('3');
			} else if (donkey === 4) {
			console.log('4');
			} else {
			console.log('?');
			}

switch		=	a switch statement allows you to check many different
			values in a more elegant format than writing separate
			if else statements.
			a switch statement starts by indicating the value or
			expression that each following 'case' will compare.
			the block follows, where potential cases of the value
			are listed, determining which case to run. Each case
			ends with a 'break' statement that tells the
			computer to exit the block. there is also a 'default'
			statement which will run if none of the cases are
			true. e.g.:
			let dunkChunk = 'wonk';
			switch (dunkChunk) {
			  case 'conk':
			    console.log('It's conkin time');
			    break;
			  case 'wonk':
			    console.log('it's wonkin time');
			    break;
			  case 'donk':
			    console.log('it's DONKin time!');
			    break;
			  default:
			    console.log('not sure what time it is!');
			    break;
			}
======================



functions
=========
			functions are used to perform a generalized task in
			multiple different scenarios


declaration	=	functions are declared using the function keyword,
			followed by the function identifier (with
			parentheses), then followed by a block of code.
			e.g.

			function greetWorld() {
				console.log('Hello World');
			}
			//this function has no parameters

			function callName(name) {
			console.log(`${name} is an idiot`)
			}

			N.B. no ';' after the last curly bracket

hoisting	=	this feature of JS allows functions to be called
			earlier in the code than they are defined. Functions
			will work when declared later, however this is not
			good practice.


calling		=	in order for the code within a function to run, the
			function needs to be called. this is done by
			typing the name of the function followed by
			parentheses.


parameters	=	parameters are declared in the parentheses
			following the functions name when the function
			is first declared. They are defined when the
			function is called, and a value is given to
			them in that call.
			Parameters can have a predetermined value
			in case there is no value declared when the
			function is called. the parameters is set to
			equal a default value when the function is
			declared, which is overwritten in the case
			that the parameter is given.
			e.g. (with and without default)

			function callMeDonkey(name = 'buddy') {
				console.log('Hey ' + name + ', you're a
				donkey!');
				};
			callMeDonkey('Remy');
			//if we didn't input 'Remy' when we called the
			//function, it would default to 'buddy'


return		=	the results of the function are evaluated and
			output. By default, the results are undefined.
			in order to print or output any results of
			the code block within the function, the
			results need to be captured with a return.
			Using the return keyword, we declare what
			will be returned, usually in the form of a
			variable or other value. When the return is
			reached, the code will stop -- e.g. in the
			case of an if...else statement, if there is
			a return within the block, that will exit
			the function with that return before some
			later, potentially default return is executed



function	=	function expressions can be defined within a
expressions		variable declaration. when doing so, the
			function is declared without a name, and is
			referred to as an anonymous function. e.g.

			const howManyDonkeys = function(cols, rows) {
				const howMany = cols * rows;
				return howMany;
			}
			howManyDonkeys(4, 4);

			N.B. function expressions cannot be hoisted!


arrow functions	=	a shorthand for declaring functions is using
			the so-called "fat arrow" notation: =>
			The parameters are first indicated within
			the parentheses

			also, functions with only a single parameter do not
			need that parameter to be enclosed in ().

			also, functions that are only a single-line block
			don't need to be enclosed in curly braces;
			the block contents will immediately follow
			the => and there is no return keyword needed (as
			it's assumed).

			e.g. (a conversion of the last function)
			const howMany = (cols, rows) => cols * rows;

=========


scope		=	scope defines where variables can be accessed
			or referenced within a program.


ARRAYS
======

arrays		=	arrays store collections of data -- an
			individual array can store similar data types
			or different ones. arrays are 0 indexed,
			so that elements in an array are counted off
			from left to right starting at 0.
			e.g.
			const donkey ['1 banana', 'double dink']

			const[0] would here equal '1 banana'
			(strings can be treated in a similar way,
			since they are indexed,	such that:
			let donkey = 'Big Dink';
			donkey[3] would = 'g'

			indexes outside of an array's currently
			defined range = undefined.

			arrays have length, equal to the number of
			elements stored within them.


push method	=	the push method can be used to add elements
			at the end of an array. push returns the new
			length of the array.


pop method	=	the pop method removes the last item of an
			array. pop returns the item that was removed

shift method	=	shift removes the first item of an array, and
			returns that item.

unshift	method	=	unshift adds an item to the beginning of an
			array, and returns the new array length.

slice method	=	the slice method returns a smaller array
			consisting of the elements with indexes
			contained within the numbers of the arguments
			passed to the slice method. the start is
			inclusive, the end is exclusive
			e.g. dinky.slice(1, 4); will return
			elements 1, 2, and 3.


indexOf method	=	the indexOf method returns the index number
			of the first instance of a value passed as
			an argument to the method. If the element is
			not found -1 will be returned.


array scope	=	if an array is called and modified within a
			function, the array is mutated outside of the
			function.


nested arrays	=	arrays can contain other arrays, referred to
			as nested arrays. if an element in an array
			is an array, and you want to refer to an
			element contained within this second array,
			the syntax for these nested indexes would be
			nestedArray[1][2], which would call the third
			array element of the array contained in the
			second array item of nestedArray.
======


loops
=====
			a programming tool that repeats an action
			until a stopping condition is satisfied.


for loop	=	consists of an initialization, a stopping
			condition, and an iteration statement, a for
			loop checks against the iterator variable to
			see whether or not it's time to stop.
			e.g.
			for (let count = 0; count < 4; count++) {
			... }


nested loops	=	when you have a loop running inside another
			loop. duh.

while loop	=	do...while loops will run at least once, then
			will evaluate whether or not to repeat based on
			a condition provided. e.g.
			i = 0
			do {
				console.log (i);
				i++;
			} while (i < 10);

break		=	the break keyword will break out of a loop at a
			specified moment, usually as a result of evaluating
			a conditional statement. e.g.
			for (let = 0; i < 10; i++) {
				console.log(i);
				if (i === 7) {
				break;
				}
			}
=====

ITERATORS
&
HOFs
=========

higher order
functions	=	Higher order functions are functions that accept
			other functions as their input. More abstraction
			can lead to greater readability and modularity.

parameters
vs.		=	parameters are the abstract place holders for values
arguments		in a function that are created when a function is
			created, whereas arguments are the actual, concrete
			values that get passed to the function at the time that
			it is called or when it runs.

invoking
vs.		=	calling a function is when you directly call it, such
calling			as $ func();	whereas invoking it would be a
			when the function is called by some other process, e.g.
			$ donkey(func);		????


callback	=	a callback function is a function that will run
functions		once another function has finished running (??).
			***Any function that is passed as an argument to a
			function is a callback function***

passing functions
as arguments	=	When we pass a function as an argument to another func-
			tion, we don't invoke the function, so when it is
			listed (e.g. func1(func2, func3, &c...); ) we don't
			write it with parentheses. If it were listed with
			parentheses, and therefor invoked, it would be the same
			as passing that function's return as an argument,
			and that would be the value of the argument that is
			used in the "outer" function.
			Instead, we want to only indicate the function that we
			want to run, and once it is ready it will be
			invoked within the outer function.

iterators	=	Some methods can be used on arrays and other "list-like"
			data where the method will "iterate" through the
			entire list and apply a function or a mapping to some
			or all of the elements.

			any iterator method has its own specific syntax and
			way of evaluating its input to produce its output.
			Please refer to the documentation for specific syntax
			descriptions.

			the folllowing are some examples:

.forEach()	=	this method will execute the same code on each element
			of an array. to use it on an array, use dot notation
			(array.foreach()) and then pass it a function as an
			argument. Its return is undefined.
			e.g.
			const letters = [a, b, c, d, e];
			letters.forEach(letter => {console.log(letter);});
			//this will simply print off the letters in sequence

.map()		=	the map method will return a new array that is the
			result of running the given callback function on a
			pre-existing array.
			e.g.
			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
			const addFive = numbers.map(number => {
				return number + 5;
				});

			or, without arrow notation

			const addFive.map(function add(number) {
			return number + 5;
			})

.filter()	=	the filter method will also return a new array, however
			this new array will return a subset of the original
			elements of the first array, after running a function
			on those elements which will return a boolean value;
			those elements that result in 'true' will be included
			in the new array and those that return 'false' will be
			excluded.
			e.g.
			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
			const greaterThanTwo = numbers.filter(number => {
			return number > 2;
			});

.findIndex()	=	the findIndex method will check through an array to
			find the first element that matches that value given,
			and will return its index number.
			e.g.
			const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
			const indexOfFour = numbers.findIndex (
				number => number === 4
			);
=========

OBJECTS
=======
			objects are essentially containers which contain
			data and functionality with some sort of relation,
			or in terms stated in the MDN documentation:
			an object is a data structure containing data and
			instructions for working with the data

object literals	=	{} are used to indicate that we wish to assign an object
			to a variable.

key-value pairs	=	when we fill an object with data, we do so by indicating
			values that are stored in memory with a name that refers
			to their location, with each pair being separated by
			a colon. Keys are strings, and in this case, if there
			are no special characters in a key, no quotation marks
			are needed.
			e.g.
			let classRoster = {
				studentA: 'Sarah',
				studentB: 'Julian',
				studentC: 'Rosco'
			};

properties	=	each property of an object is a key-value pair.
			properties can be accessed either by using dot notation
			(e.g. object.property) or by using bracket notation
			(e.g. object[property]). In the instance that a
			property is indicated by a key with special characters
			(spaces, numbers, &c.), you MUST use bracket notation,
			though you can also use bracket notation with key-names
			that you could also indicate via dot notation.
			With bracket notation, you can also pass a variable
			inside the brackets to select the key you are looking
			for, where you can't do this with dot notation.

assignment	=	properties can be either reassigned / updated or added
			to an object by writing
			object[property] = value;
			even if an object was declared with const you can still
			"mutate" it with assigning values to its properties.

			you can delete a property from an object by using the
			delete operator. e.g.
			delete object.property;

methods		=	when data stored in an object is a function, that's
			called a method just like methods for built-in objects
			that we've been using so far. The syntax is slightly
			different since the key acts as the way we refer to the
			function, so when we declare it, we do so as an anon-
			ymous function e.g.
			key: function () {...code...};
			or more tidy:
			key () {...code...};

			methods are invoked by listing the object name with the
			dot operator and the method name with parentheses, e.g.
			object.method();	// with any variables in the
						// parentheses

nested objects	=	you can nest objects by assigning objects as properties
			e.g.
			object: {
				nestObj: {
				   prop1: 'boink',
				   prop2: 'zoink',
				   prop3: 'doink'
				}
			}
			and call them like:
			objects.nestObj[prop1]

passed by
reference	=	when a variable within an object is passed into a
			function as an argument, the function looks at the
			location in memory where that value is stored, so if an
			object is mutated within a function, it stays mutated
			outside of that function.

for...in	=	for...in loops will iterate through each property of an
			object while executing a block of code.
			e.g.
			for (let prop in object.property) {
			console.log(object[prop]);
			};
			//NB you must use bracket notation for the variable
			//defined in the for...in loop

this		=	the 'this' keyword provides access to a 'calling' object
			when you are writing a method inside of an object.
			e.g.
			const object = {
			prop1: 23,
			prop2: 47,
			method () {
			return `prop1 is ${this.prop1} and prop2 is
			${this.[prop2]}`;
			}
			};

			when using => functions in an object, the 'this' keyword
			will bind to that function and will therefor usually
			print undefined, so AVOID using arrow functions in
			object methods. (which is kinda weird imho because the
			shorter syntax that you can use in a function is shorter
			than the arrow function syntax but w/e...)

privacy		=	the concept of privacy in objects concerns whether or
			not a property is something we want to be mutable.
			In JAVASCRIPT, there is no built in way to ensure object
			privacy, so devs use an underscore at the beginning of a
			property name to indicate that it shouldn't be modified.

getters		=	getter methods return internal properties of objects
			using the get keyword. While retrieving information,
			getters can also return different information based on
			conditional statements. getter methods can be called
			without parentheses. e.g.
			let object  = {
				prop1: 23,
				prop2: 'bub',
				get printBoth() {
					if (this.prop1 && this.prop2) {
						return `${this.prop1} ${this.prop2}`;
					} else {
						return 'something's missing!';
					}
				}
			};
			console.log( object.printBoth );
			//prints '23 bub'


setters		=	setter methods access internal properties of an object
			and can also set or re-assign some of those properties.
			You also don't need parentheses for setter methods, and
			from the outside it just looks like you're reassigning a
			property of the object, however setter methods also
			allow you to check input to see if something is

			let object = {
				prop1: 24
				set propChange(newProp) {
					if (typeof newProp == 'number') {
					prop1 = newProp;
					} else {
					console.log('this needs to be a number');
					}
				}
			};
			object.setMeth = 'newvalue';
			//would log the above statement
			//also -- setter methods don't need to be called w
			//parentheses -- setter methods need precisely one
			//variable.

			getters and setters are NOT functions.

			Get and Set behave as properties, and they can use the
			same name because of the dependency set has on get, and
			because they are both 'running' on the same variable.
			They are also both able to be used with the same name
			because of the unique way that you 'call' them,
			respectively:

			console.log( object.newProp );	//for getters
			object.newProp = 43;		//for setters

factory
