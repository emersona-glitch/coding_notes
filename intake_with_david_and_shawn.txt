bby oneview (one stop shop)
but for EVERYTHING

dynatrace, oracle client


(llinux) Server and sudo access for intakes


for future: connect to CMDB to get server details
currently Getting list from vcenter

daniel: pete kruger, BSM and CMDB getting sunset, activating snow-discovery instead!

dan holtz (+ ryan): when this new process/tool comes into place and 

conversing with partner teams to make sure the tools/processes that we're building 
are scalable / growable
and that it REALLY is the one stop shop!

how do we incorporate an MDR

David Lindberg:
  this inputs into jira,  
  (sekhar's design) is only single INTERFACE, 
  not a single source of truth, requests are NOT going to live in this
  tool

NOT duplicating processes that already exist, just a redirect for right now

conversation still to be had: will users/teams be able to create their own intake forms

Mike: we are not source of data, we are an aggregate -- how do we make an experience easier

Our process is not going to make firewall rule request simpler -- 
  shawn siemens and ryan binkey

David: There is a huge portal project happening to move to service now, why do we need this?
        there is a search setup being built, so why do we need this?
        has zach pierce / arch review board seen this?
        yes, pierce knows, hasn't seen demo
      
bifrost, firemon, apis; once we get answers from all of these people 

David is worried about redundant work; also, if there are things that can be in SNOW, 
  why not develop it there from the beginning

  Having a portal for all things infrastructure makes sense; I'm worried about the automation

Bestbuy ConnectÂ® -> one stop hub
  (however, there will be micro-portals)

currently the team talks to other teams one on one
david can connect us with user experience review/feedback team?
this team can be tasked with researching what we need

shawn:
  whatever you want to do with APIs, specifically change APIs,
  the change module is going through a massive migration,
  the updated api framework will not be availble till 2022
  so whatever you build on the API framework will need to be updated next year

mike:
  We'll be given access to a lower environment so we can test changes?
