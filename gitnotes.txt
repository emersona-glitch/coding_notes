GIT NOTES
=========

Download GIT:
download from browser, OR
$ xcode-select --install
//will install xcode tools


Check to see if you have GIT:
git --version
//should print version of GIT installed.


Configuring GIT:
git config --global user.name "[your username]"
git config --global user.email "[your email]"
//you can check what these are set to by typing the above commands
//without the username/email argument

"git," when typed into the terminal, is a command,
the "config" is called a task, which is performed by the git
command. The "--global" is a flag (which in this case indicates to
set the username/email globally for the whole computer).
