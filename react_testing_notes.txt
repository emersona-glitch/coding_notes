Notes from Testing React Applications, v2 on Front End Masters

Forms of testing

  Static code analysis
    do not require written tests / configurations
    (linting? static type checking?)
    (Prettier can be used to format / style code)

  Unit testing / Integration testing can be a bit fluid with React because
  unit testing would ideally be taking care of dependencies.
  
  ////  ERROR NOTES BEGIN  ////
    Received error while trying to run tests for the item-list.js in /simple-react:
      Error: `fsevents` unavailable (this watcher can only be used on Darwin)

    So I entered this in command line, 
      $ brew install watchman
    
    at the recommendations of the people talking about this issue on github here
      https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

    and then I got this:
      dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.67.dylib

    so I tried running:
      $ brew upgrade
    and then:
      $ brew cleanup

    and then everything worked and I'm very glad about that because I have no 
    idea what's going on :^)
